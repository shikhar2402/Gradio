# Gradio: Build Machine Learning Web Apps â€” in Python

## This repository aims to use latest machine learning models like stable diffusion, vit and language models to integrate with gradio library. 


Gradio is an open-source Python library that is used to build machine learning and data science demos and web applications.

With Gradio, you can quickly create a beautiful user interface around your machine learning models or data science workflow and let people "try it out" by dragging-and-dropping in their own images,
pasting text, recording their own voice, and interacting with your demo, all through the browser.


Gradio is useful for:

- **Demoing** your machine learning models for clients/collaborators/users/students.

- **Deploying** your models quickly with automatic shareable links and getting feedback on model performance.

- **Debugging** your model interactively during development using built-in manipulation and interpretation tools.

## Quickstart

**Prerequisite**: Gradio requires Python 3.7 or higher, that's all!

### What Does Gradio Do?

One of the *best ways to share* your machine learning model, API, or data science workflow with others is to create an **interactive app** that allows your users or colleagues to try out the demo in their browsers.
